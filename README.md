# Rating-Matrix-Factorization

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas such as Amazon, UberEats, Netflix, and Youtube. Matrix factorization is a way to generate latent features when multiplying two different kinds of entities. Collaborative filtering is the application of matrix factorization to identify the relationship between items’ and users’ entities. With the input of users’ ratings on the shop items, we would like to predict how the users would rate the items so the users can get the recommendation based on the prediction.

In this Python Code, we are implementing gradient descent technique to perform matrix factorization.
